# xpmt-auto-startup-landing

A modern, black/blue landing page built with **Astro** + **Tailwind**.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build to `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build

## Notes

- Global styles live in `src/styles/global.css` and are imported once via `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`.
- The landing page is `src/pages/index.astro` (hero, features, social proof, CTA, FAQ, footer).
