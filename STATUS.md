## Goal
Ship a modern, fast, black/blue startup landing page.

## In progress

- Rate-limit hardening (Clawdbot TPM stalls) — owner: reliability-eng
- QA review (a11y + responsiveness) — owner: qa-reviewer

## Blockers
- None

## Next (CTO)
1) Ensure Tailwind is wired into the Astro layout and the site builds.
2) Push visible commits early and often.
3) Add basic deploy (GitHub Pages) once the page is stable.
